The program implements a maximum likelihood method to compute luminosity functions (LF) in the presence of observational errors and biases. Currently it supports the following featrures:

- Schechter parametrization and stepwise (partial)
- Take into account errors in observed magnitudes
- Take into account errors in observed redshifts (in progress)
- Compute the normalization of the LF and its covariance with the rest of LF parameters.
- Take into account selection function in magnitude.
- Simulation of mock samples derived from a priori LFs.
